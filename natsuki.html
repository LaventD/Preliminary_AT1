        <p>Hey there, I'm Natsuki, one of the members of the literature club in "Doki Doki Literature Club!" Don't let my small stature fool you—I may be the youngest, but I've got plenty of attitude packed into this tiny package.</p>

<p>When I'm not busy baking sweets, you can usually find me buried in a manga or graphic novel. Yeah, I'm not the biggest fan of the fancy poetry stuff the others are into. Give me a good manga any day, and I'm set!</p>

<p>But hey, don't get me wrong. Just because I prefer manga doesn't mean I can't appreciate a well-crafted story. And when it comes to writing, I've got my own style, thank you very much. Short and sweet—that's how I like it.</p>

<p>Despite my tough exterior, I've got a soft spot for my friends in the club. Sure, we might not always see eye to eye, especially with that one person... But deep down, we've got each other's backs. That's what counts, right?</p>

<p>So yeah, that's me, Natsuki. I may not be the most outspoken or refined member of the club, but I've got my own unique charm. And hey, who knows? Maybe you'll find yourself drawn to it.</p>

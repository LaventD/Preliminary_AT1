      <h2>The Dark and Twisted Storyline of Doki Doki Literature Club</h2>
      <p><strong>Warning: Spoilers Ahead!</strong></p>
      <p>Doki Doki Literature Club is not your typical visual novel. What starts as a seemingly innocent dating simulator soon takes a dark and twisted turn. The game follows a high school student who joins the Literature Club and interacts with its four members: Sayori, Natsuki, Yuri, and Monika.</p>
      <p>As the protagonist spends more time with the club members, strange events begin to occur. Sayori, the protagonist's childhood friend and the vice-president of the club, confesses her love for the protagonist and struggles with depression. Depending on the player's choices, Sayori's story can take a tragic turn.</p>
      <p>Yuri, the shy and introverted member of the club, becomes increasingly obsessive and unstable, leading to disturbing incidents involving self-harm and manipulation. Natsuki, the outspoken and assertive member, faces issues of neglect and abuse at home.</p>
      <p>However, the most unsettling character is Monika, the president of the Literature Club. Monika breaks the fourth wall and demonstrates self-awareness of being in a game. She manipulates the game's code to sabotage the other characters and ensure that the player's affection is directed solely towards her.</p>
      <p>The game explores themes of mental health, existentialism, and the nature of reality. It challenges the player's perception of the visual novel genre and creates an immersive and unsettling experience.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, Doki Doki Literature Club is not just a game; it's an emotional rollercoaster that leaves a lasting impact on players long after they've finished playing.</p>
